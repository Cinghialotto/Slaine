Slaine C64 Source Code
(c)Michael J Archer

Source code unusual one as this game used the bitmap screen on C64, a twist on the traditional text adventures where the elements and thoughts of sliane where presented on the screen.
Code used macro's a lot of generate the scrolling of the text. Assembler was using ADE on the BBC Micro, and sent to the C64 via a parallel link cable.
